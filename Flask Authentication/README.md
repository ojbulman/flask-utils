This Blueprint provides role based authentication to the Flask framework.
Additionally, this also provides the option to authorize based upon feature flags as well as user role.

As there are many possibilities which are likely custom in many cases, this modules does not provide either the database to hold user data or the process to read and check user credentials. This does provide the authentication and authorisation functions to form a solid framework.
